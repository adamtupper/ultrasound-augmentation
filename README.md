# Revisiting Data Augmentation for Ultrasound Images

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository serves as a landing page for the packages and official source code for our TMLR article [Revisiting Data Augmentation for Ultrasound Images](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iGcxlTLIL5).

## `ultrabench`

[UltraBench](https://github.com/adamtupper/ultrabench) is a standardized benchmark of ultrasound image classification and semantic segmentation tasks for training and evaluating machine learning models.

## `usaugment`

[USAugment](https://github.com/adamtupper/usaugment) is a Python package that provides implementations of the ultrasound-specific data augmentations to use when training machine learning models for ultrasound image analysis tasks.

## `usaugment-experiments`

The code and documentation for running the experiments presented in the paper and reproducing the results.
